## Set Up Users and Access (TestFlight)

> You repeat this step if you need to add a User to your account. For example, you want to add another adult who can install the app on your child's phone or you want a spouse or friend to have a copy of the app on their phone as backup for a trip.

> As a developer, you are already included as a user with the Role of Account Holder, Admin. But you will need to add yourself to the TestFlight group for your App.

Once the first build completes, you will be able to configure *TestFlight* for the app.

!!! tip "Add Each User One Time"
    Once you add a user to have access to your TestFlight for this app, you don't need to do it again - it remains available to them across rebuilds and different versions of that app.

You are configuring a private capability for your family using an Internal Testing group. You need the *Apple ID* email address for each adult installing from your build. When building for a child, you will use your own *Apple ID*, not theirs. See [*TestFlight* for a Child](phone-install.md#testflight-for-a-child).

1. First you need to add the email address(es) to your *App Store Connect* Access Users list:

    * Open this link: [Users and Access](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/users){: target="_blank" }
        * You must provide a role for each person - `Customer Support` is a good choice
        * Once you have added them here, you'll be able to select them in the `TestFlight` group for your app

1. Open this link: [App Store Connect / Apps](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps){: target="_blank" } to view your apps; log in if needed. Then select your *Loop* app. Click on the `TestFlight` tab then click the blue plus button (<font color="#2997FF">:material-plus-circle:</font>) next to `Internal Testing` to add a group.

1. Fill out the name you want for the `Internal Testing` group
    * Be sure to check the box `Enable automatic distribution`
    * Click `Create` when done (this can always be modified later)

1. As soon as you create the group, you'll be asked who should be included
    * Click in the box beside each person you want to include
    * Each person in this group will get an email each time you update (build again) using the <code>*GitHub* Browser Build</code> method
    * Click `Add` when you are done
    * If building for a child, you will send the invitation to yourself because you will install it for your child: See [TestFlight for a Child](phone-install.md#testflight-for-a-child)

## Next Step

It is now time to install your *Loop* app using the *TestFlight* app on the phone: [Install on Phone](phone-install.md).
