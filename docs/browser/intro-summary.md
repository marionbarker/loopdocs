## Summary of Steps

???+ info "Time Estimate (click to open/close)"
    - If you have never built the *Loop* app (allow up to one week elapsed time)
        * Request and get an <span>*Apple Developer* Account</span>: 1-2 days
        * Create and configure your *GitHub* account and `repositories`: 1-2 hours
        * Add <code>Secrets</code> (requires *Apple Developer* Account): 1 hour
        * Perform the *GitHub* `Action` steps: 30 minutes to 2 hours
    - If you have previously built the *Loop* app with *Xcode* you have fewer steps and are probably familiar with some of the concepts
        * Expect 1 to 4 hours

???+ abstract "Summary for Browser Build with Links (click to open/close)"
    There is a lot of introductory information on these pages.

    * You can skip some sections but please read this one: [Save Your Information](intro-summary.md#save-your-information)

    A narrated video is available:

    * [How to Build the *Loop* App With a Web Browser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiu5ho0MTW8){: target="_blank" }

    Once you have *Apple Developer* and *GitHub* accounts, the steps below are a high-level summary with links to the detailed section of this LoopDocs page.

    You can think of the first part as a scavenger hunt where you find or generate and save six <code>Secrets</code>.

???+ question "FAQs (click to open/close)"
    - **Do I need a Mac computer?** No. This can be done on any browser, although it will be easier using a computer or tablet than just using a phone.
    - **Isn't it hard to build every 90 days?** The initial setup and installation take a lot of your focused time. But once you build, future updates and builds are automatic. You just need to keep your Apple Developer account up to date. Review any email that says a GitHub action failed - read the error and take action.
    - **Can you explain the new automatic building?** See this section [Automatic Update, Build, Install](phone-install.md#automatic-update-build-install){: target="_blank" } for more explanations
    - **Can I use this for my child?** You, as the adult, can install using *TestFlight* on your child's phone. The explicit steps are provided at [Install on Phone: *TestFlight* for a Child](phone-install.md#testflight-for-a-child){: target="_blank" }.
    - **Can I still use my customizations?** Yes. [Customize using Browser](custom-browser.md){: target="_blank" }
    - **Is there a build video?** Yes. [How to Build the *Loop* App With a Web Browser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiu5ho0MTW8){: target="_blank" }

## Automatic Build of Loop

When you follow the directions on this page, for Loop 3.4 and later, you configure your app to automatically build at least once a month. You also configure your app to be updated within one week of a new release, in other words, when the LoopKit/LoopWorkspace main branch is updated.

### Make a <code>Secrets</code> Reference File

As you move through this page, there will be a lot of instructions regarding your <code>Secrets</code>. Please save yourself a lot of agony. Make a <code>Secrets</code> Reference folder and then create a <code>Secrets</code> Reference file in it.

You don't need to know anything about the <code>Secrets</code> or any other steps on this page to do this. Come up with your own names, but make sure you know where you put them.

1. Decide on where you want your <code>Secrets</code> saved and create a special folder
2. Open a text-only editor (do not use a Smart Editor, those might change capitalization or formatting and ruin your <code>Secrets</code>)
    * Create a blank <code>Secrets</code> Reference file using the text-only editor
    * Tap on the copy icon below to copy the template and paste it into your blank file
    * Save the file
3. As you move through the steps on this page, fill in the file
    * The `##` characters are used to indicate sections or titles (text-only file)
    * Then there is a reference pattern for each SECRET, replace that with your SECRET
4. In addition to the <code>Secrets</code>, this template has places for other pieces of information you may find handy to save in the same file
5. At the very beginning is a place to indicate the last day you updated the file

``` { .bash .copy title="Template to use for Secrets" }
MySecretsReferenceFile.txt

## This file updated on: DD MMM YYYY

Information needed to use Browser Build.
The same secrets are used for every app you build.

First some handy username and password information:

## Apple ID username for your Developer account is the associated email:
<your information here>
suggest you use your desired password tool to save the password for this account

## GitHub username
<your information here>
suggest you use your desired password tool to save the password for this account

These are the Six Secrets in alphabetical order - each one shows the expected format.
Delete each prototype as you gather your own secrets.
The letter A indicates an alphanumeric character.
Some may be lower case, some upper case and some numerals.
The FASTLANE_KEY may have additional characters included.
For that one copy the entire key
including -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
through
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----

1. Paid *Apple Developer* account ($99/year)
1. Free *GitHub* account

#### Prerequisites to Install Loop

To install Loop, you need the free *TestFlight* app, from the *Apple* App Store, installed on your [Compatible Phone](../build/phone.md).

#### Prerequisites to Use Loop

To use Loop, you need a [Compatible Pump](../build/pump.md) and [Compatible CGM](../build/cgm.md). For pumps other than Omnipod DASH, you also need a [RileyLink Compatible Device](../build/rileylink.md).

## New Terms with <code>*GitHub* Browser Build</code>

[<span class="loop-big">:material-skip-forward:</span>](#save-your-information) You can read details about new terms with *GitHub* build or skip ahead to [Save Your Information](#save-your-information).

The <code>*GitHub* Browser Build</code> may use new and unfamiliar **terms**.

Some of these **terms** have ToolTips, so hover your mouse over those - or review them in the [Glossary](../faqs/glossary.md){: target="_blank" }.

* Some terms in the Glossary are not in alphabetical order. All the <code>Secrets</code> discussed on this page, are listed after <code>Secrets</code> in the Glossary.

If this summary of terms is confusing, finish reviewing the whole page and then come back.

* `Actions`: available in your *GitHub* account to build your app (once you follow the instructions on this page)
    * With `Loop 3`, the actions: `Validate Secrets`, <code>Add Identifiers</code>, `Create Certificates`, and `Build Loop` enable users to build the *Loop* app from a browser on any computer
    * If <code>*GitHub* Browser Build</code> Actions are not operating as you expect, check [*GitHub* Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/){: target="_blank" } to see if it is *GitHub* problem.
* <code>Secrets</code>: are required to enable *GitHub* to build the *Loop* app using *GitHub* Actions
    * Six <code>Secrets</code> must be added to your fork of LoopWorkspace
    * These <code>Secrets</code> work for any branch in your fork (`main` or `dev`, for example)
    * These <code>Secrets</code> can be added to [Other Apps](other-apps.md) configured with the same <code>*GitHub* Browser Build</code> method
    * For those who feel confident using *GitHub*, there are optional instructions to configure a free organizational account (for your personal use) that allows you to enter the <code>Secrets</code> only once, see [Use a *GitHub* Organization Account](other-apps.md#use-a-github-organization-account){: target="_blank" }, and have them available for every repository in that organization account
* API `Key`:`Application Programming Interface Key`
    * You obtain and save this key from the *Apple Developer* website
    * Doing this provides 3 of your <code>Secrets</code>
    * It is required to enable your *GitHub* account to interface with *Apple* to create your app
* `Identifiers`: are required to build the *Loop* app with <code>*GitHub* Browser Build</code> (these are automatically generated for you)
    * Four Identifier Names must be associated with your `App Group`
        * `Loop`, `Loop Intent Extension`, `Loop Status Extension` and `Loop Widget Extension`
    * Two Identifier Names will exist but do not require that association
        * `WatchApp` and `WatchAppExtension`
    * The `Identifier` screen, has **`NAME`** and **`IDENTIFIER`** columns
        * If you previously built with Xcode, the items in the **`NAME`** column may start with `XC`
        * The items under the **`IDENTIFIER`** column match the table in [Add `App Group` to Identifiers](prepare-app.md#add-app-group-to-identifiers){: target="_blank" }
* [`App Store Connect`](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com){: target="_blank" }: a website available for *Apple Developer*s to review apps build with your *Apple Developer* account
    * Once you purchase an *Apple Developer* annual account, you are an *Apple Developer* and have access to this site
    * Most Loopers will not have an App until using the <code>*GitHub* Browser Build</code>
    * The instructions walk you through creating and naming your app: [Create Loop App in App Store Connect](prepare-app.md#create-loop-app-in-app-store-connect){: target="_blank" }

## Save Your Information

**Everyone needs to read this section!**

You need to keep a digital copy of your 6 <code>Secrets</code>.

* You need to copy and paste those <code>Secrets</code> to build the app with a browser
* Make sure your editor does not change any characters in your <code>Secrets</code>; use a text-only editor like NotePad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac)
* Many people add other information to the <code>Secrets</code> file for easy reference

!!! tip "Archive Your Information"
    To complete the steps on this page, you will need a username, email address, and password for *Apple* and *GitHub*. You will find, generate or make up six <code>Secrets</code> as instructed.

    * Record this information in a safe place where you can find them
    * A digital copy is best for copying and pasting in different locations

    **Be sure to use a Text-Only editor like NotePad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac) to archive your information.**

!!! info "A Note about Capitalization and Spaces"
    In places, you use a name like "`FastLane API Key`" or "`FastLane Access Token`". Please copy from the docs to use those exact names.

    The <code>Secrets</code> that you add use names that are capitalized and use underscore ++"_"++ instead of spaces. Be precise and careful.

!!! important "Use a Text-Only Editor"
    **Be sure to use a Text-Only editor like NotePad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac) to archive your information.**

    If you use a "smart" editor, it may change lower-case letters to upper-case letters at the beginning of a line when you paste items into your archive file.

    If even one character is capitalized when it should not be, you will get [Errors with Browser Build](bb-errors.md).

    If you use a smart editor to store your FASTLANE_KEY, you are likely to get the mysterious `invalid curve name` error.
